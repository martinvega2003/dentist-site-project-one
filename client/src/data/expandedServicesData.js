      longDescription: `Dental checkups are an essential part of oral health and overall well-being. These regular visits ensure early detection of oral health problems such as cavities, gum disease, and even oral cancer. During a dental checkup, your dentist will conduct a thorough examination of your teeth, gums, and mouth, using specialized tools to assess for issues that may not be immediately noticeable. Professional cleanings are also a key part of these checkups, as they remove plaque and tartar buildup that regular brushing cannot address. For individuals of all ages, checkups help maintain a bright, healthy smile and prevent the progression of minor concerns into costly, painful issues. Regular dental visits build a strong foundation for oral health, making it easier to address problems in their early stages.`,

        longDescription: `Jaw surgery, or orthognathic surgery, is a corrective procedure designed to address severe jaw misalignment, bite issues, or facial asymmetry. It is often recommended for patients with difficulty chewing, speaking, or breathing due to improper jaw positioning. The procedure involves repositioning the jawbones to restore balance, functionality, and aesthetics. Jaw surgery can significantly enhance facial harmony, improve oral health, and provide relief from TMJ disorders or sleep apnea. With a personalized treatment plan and expert surgical care, patients can achieve a healthier, more confident smile.`,
