                answer: "Mild discomfort after dental treatment is normal and typically subsides within a day or two.

                question: "How do I care for my dental implants?", 
                answer: "Proper care for dental implants includes daily brushing and flossing to maintain cleanliness and prevent plaque buildup. Using a soft-bristled toothbrush and non-abrasive toothpaste is recommended to protect the implant’s surface. Incorporate mouthwash into your routine to reach areas that brushing may miss. Regular dental checkups are crucial for monitoring the implant’s stability and addressing any concerns early. With consistent care, dental implants can provide a lifelong solution for missing teeth."

                question: "Can I eat normally after a filling?", 
                answer: "After receiving a filling, it’s best to wait until the anesthesia wears off before eating to avoid accidentally biting your cheeks, lips, or tongue. Once sensation returns, stick to soft foods for the first 24 hours, especially if your filling is new or involves deeper layers. Avoid hard, sticky, or crunchy foods that might dislodge the filling. Following these precautions ensures the filling sets properly and contributes to long-lasting oral health."
